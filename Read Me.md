# Cocoa Basics

This repository contains the code to go along with
my Cocoa Basics [blog post series].
I’ve tried to keep the commit history readable
so you can browse through it commit-by-commit as you read the posts.
I’ve also tagged commits corresponding with the final state the code is in after each post
to make the history easier to navigate.
